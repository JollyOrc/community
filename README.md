The [Solid GitHub account](https://github.com/solid) was started by the [Solid academic project at MIT](https://solid.mit.edu) and today is run by the [Solid Team](https://github.com/solid/information/blob/master/solid-team.md) using [defined processes](https://github.com/solid/information/blob/master/decision-making-processes.md).

Solid aims to decentralise power on the web to ensure that the web is used for the global public interest by providing the Solid specification. Read more about the [Solid values](https://github.com/solid/information/blob/master/solid-values.md). 

# Solid Specifications 
The Solid specifications can be found in the following repositories: 
* [Solid](https://github.com/solid/solid-spec)  
* [Web Access Control](https://github.com/solid/web-access-control-spec) 
* [WebID OIDC](https://github.com/solid/webid-oidc-spec)

# W3C Solid Community Group
Anyone can implement the Solid specifications and is encouraged to [join the W3C SOlid Coommunity Group](https://www.w3.org/community/solid/) where the the development of the Solid specifications as well as coordinating those who are implementing the Solid is discussed. [Minutes of previous conversations and agendas of upcoming conversations of the W3C Solid community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/solid/wiki/Meetings) are publicly available. You can find a list of all organisations implementing the Solid specifications.

 # Pod Providers
 You read more about [self hosting](https://github.com/solid/information/blob/master/self-hosting.md) or share your experience of self hosting a Pod. Alternatively, check out the list of [Pod Providers](https://github.com/solid/information/blob/master/pod-providers.md). 

# Solid Projects 
[Solid Projects](https://github.com/orgs/solid/projects) are implementations of the Solid specification within Solid Github account. Anyone can submit a project proposal to the Solid Team including a description of the project name, scope, manager, contributors and names of associated repositories needed. The Project Manager is responsible for determining the scope of a [project](https://github.com/orgs/solid/projects) as well as supporting the coordination of the Project Team Member. The Project Manager will ensure that any issues and pull requests related to their project are assigned to Project Team Member, ensure that those assigned are on the case, and are responsible for merging pull requests and closing issues associated to their project. A Project Manager has admin rights over the project they manage. A Project Team Member is working on a specific official Solid [project](https://github.com/orgs/solid/projects). Project Team Members may have issues assigned to them by the Project  Manager. Project Team Members have admin rights of projects they are working on. If you would like to join an existing project, reach out to corresponding Project Manager. If you would like to start a new project, reach out to the Solid Manager with your project proposal including a defined aim, Project Manager, and Project Team.

# Solid Events 
[Solid Events](https://github.com/solid/information/blob/master/solid-events.md) provide an opportunity for anyone to meet and talk about Solid in person. Anyone can organise a Solid Event. If you are thinking about running a Solid Event in your city below is some guidance from previous Solid Event Organisers. If you have run a Solid Event, please contribute to the guidance information and share your learnings with the Solid Manager to incorporate. If you are organising a Solid Event, let others know about it by publishing it. 

# Solid Challenges 
Solid Challenges are set by a lead who can provide guidance to those who participate in a specific goal. Previous Solid Challenges include: 
* [Solid Chat](https://gitter.im/solid/chat-app) by [Jose Emilio Labra Gayo](https://github.com/labra)

# Solid Resources 
If you know of any grants or channels to apply to resources that would allow developers to focus on building their application on solid, please do share them.
