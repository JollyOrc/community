[Solid](https://github.com/solid) is an initiative led by Tim Berners-Lee with the goal of decentralising power on the web to ensure that the web is used for the global public interest as defined by the [Solid values](https://github.com/solid/community/blob/master/solid-values.md). Currently, Solid is ready for developers to build on Solid rather than end users. 

[Solid Opening Hours](https://zoom.us/j/334489790) are a chance to chat with the Solid Team. You can tune in every Tuesday at 15.30 CET for an hour.

[Solid World](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/solid-world-tickets-53692744444?aff=erellivmlt) is a podcast where you can get up to speed with Solid and tune into the latest conversations. You can also read the latest [status update](https://github.com/solid/information/blob/master/status.md) 

The [Solid Team](solid-team.md) has a closed gitter chat and there are weekly recurring [Solid support meetings](https://github.com/solid/information/blob/master/solid-support-agenda-and-minutes.md) via online calls moderated by the Solid Manager. Individuals with specified Solid roles need to attend the Solid support meetings if stated in their role description. The roles and responsibilites of the Solid Team are defined by the Solid Leader who also appoints individuals to those roles. If you would like to apply for a role, [contact the Solid Manager](solid-team.md) with your cv and motivation statement.

# Building  Solid
Anyone can build on Solid, there are multiple ways in which you can build: 
 * [Solid Specifications](#solid-specifications)
 * [Pod Providers](#pod-providers)
 * [Solid Apps](#solid-apps)
 * [Solid Developer Tools](#solid-developer-tools)
 * [Solid Events](#solid-events)
 
Solid encourages you to keep the [code of conduct](code-of-conduct.md) in mind. If you are have a concern you can contact the Solid Team or submit and issue.

[Discourse](https://forum.solidproject.org/), the [solid/chat](https://gitter.im/solid/chat) on gitter and [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/SOLID) are great places to ask general questions which you can also search for on the [Frequently Unanswered Questions](https://github.com/solid/information/blob/master/frequently-unanswered-questions.md).

User Testing is carried out to systematically test assumptions on a specific element. If you would like to become part of the User Testing Panel or would like to test an item that you hvave build on Solid [contact the Solid Manager](https://github.com/solid/information/blob/master/solid-team.md).
 
## Solid Specifications
At the core of Solid are the Solid specifications: 
 - [Solid](https://github.com/solid/solid-spec)  
 - [Web Access Control](https://github.com/solid/web-access-control-spec) 
 - [WebID OIDC](https://github.com/solid/webid-oidc-spec) 
 
Terms used in the Solid specifications are defined in the [Solid Dictionary](https://github.com/solid/information/blob/master/solid-dictionary.md) and a full overview of the [architecture](https://github.com/solid/solid-architecture) explains how the Solid specifications are interrelated. 

The Solid specifications are discussed and developed by the [W3C Solid Community Group](https://www.w3.org/information/solid/wiki/Main_Page) which is [open for anyone to join]. The Solid W3C Community Group communicates using a mailing list and biweekly hour long calls which you will be part of if you join. The [agenda and minutes](https://www.w3.org/community/solid/wiki/Meetings) for the calls are publicly available. 

Changes to the spec are made using the following process: 

Step 1. Making a Suggestion
	If you would like to make a suggestion for a speific change to code or text submit a pull request and if you would like to raise a general point open an [issue](https://github.com/solid/information/tree/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE). 
	
 Step 2. Inviting a Conversation around your Suggestion to Find Consensus
	  Let others know about your suggestion by posting it on [solid/suggestions](https://gitter.im/solid/suggestions). Solid/suggestions is not a place to talk about the suggestion, this happens in the pull request or issue itself.How long does it take to process a suggestions? Pull requests and issues associated to the the spec (i.e. [solid spec](https://github.com/solid/solid-spec), [web access control spec](https://github.com/solid/web-access-control-spec), and [webid oidc spec](https://github.com/solid/webid-oidc-spec)) and the [Solid information repo](https://github.com/solid/information) need to be open for a minimum of three days to give other a chance to share their opinion to be considered. Pull requests and issues associated to all other repos can be closed immediately and do not have a minimum time they have to be left open unless they deviate from the spec in which case they need to be open for a minimum of three days. 
 
 Step 3. Coming to a Conclusion through Compromise  
 	Who is responsible for processing the suggestion? The repository manager of the repository to which the suggestion pertains to will be responsible for merging and closing the pull request or issue. If there is a difference of opinion, parties are encouraged to talk to find a compromise. If a compromise cannot be met the Solid Leader will make the final judgement.

## Pod Providers 
Users can either use a Pod Provider who self host. There is an open channel for people to talk about self hosting. 

Anyone have become a Pod Provider. 

There are example [Solid Servers](https://github.com/solid/solid) with [changelog](https://github.com/solid/node-solid-server/blob/release/v5.0.0/CHANGELOG.md) documenting the versions that can be used as a reference by Pod Providers. 

If you are building a Pod, let others know about your [Pod Providers](pod-providers.md). If you have shown demonstrable contributions judged by the Solid Team you will be invited to the closed Pod Provider gitter thread to talk with other Pod Providers. 

## Solid Apps  
Anyone can build a Solid app. 

If you are building a Solid app, let others know about your [Solid App](https://github.com/solid/solid-apps). If you have shown demonstrable contributions judged by the Solid Team you will be invited to the closed Solid app developer gitter thread to talk with other Solid app developers 

## Solid Developer Tools
Anyone can build Solid app developer tools. 

If you are building a Solid app developer tools, let others know about your [Developer Support Tool Providers](https://github.com/solid/information/blob/master/developer-tools.md). If you have shown demonstrable contributions judged by the Solid Team you will be invited to the closed Solid app developer tools gitter thread to talk with others who are building Solid app developers tools. 

## Solid Events
[Solid Events](solid-events.md) provide an opportunity for anyone to meet and talk about Solid in person. 

Anyone can organise a Solid Event. 

You can read [guidance](solid-event-guidance.md) from previous event organiser, which you can also contribute to once you have completed your Solid Event. 

If you are organising a Solid Event, [let others know about the details](solid-events.md). If you have shown demonstrable contributions judged by the Solid Team you will be invited to the closed Solid Event organisers gitter thread to talk with others who are building Solid app developers tools.
