The [Solid GitHub account](https://github.com/solid) was started by the [Solid academic project at MIT](https://solid.mit.edu). In summer 2018 the private company [inrupt](https://inrupt.com) based in Boston, USA, made significant contributions to the [Solid GitHub account](https://github.com/solid).

The [Solid GitHub account](https://github.com/solid) includes the following. 

# Solid Specifications 
The Solid specifications can be found in the following repositories: 
* [Solid](https://github.com/solid/solid-spec)  
* [Web Access Control](https://github.com/solid/web-access-control-spec) 
* [WebID OIDC](https://github.com/solid/webid-oidc-spec) 

The [Solid Team](solid-team.md) works with the [W3C Solid Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/solid/) (which you can also read about on the [Solid/information solid.md](solid.md) to support the development of the Solid specifications as well as coordinating those who are implementing the Solid. 

# Information about Solid
Information about Solid  can be found in the following repos:
information, vocab, solid-tutorial-intro, solid-tutorial-angular, solid-tutorial-rdflib.js, profile-viewer-tutorial, understanding-linked-data, solid-tutorial-pastebin, web-summit-2018, intro-to-solid-slides, releases, solid-architecture, user guide, solid-namespace, solid-platform, solid-apps, and solid.mit.edu

Currently there is no defined individual responsible for these repositories, although anyone can suggest to update the information by submitting a pull request or issue. If you would like to become responsible for these repositories including keeping the information up to date and incorporating suggestions from pull requests and issues contact the Solid Manager. The information in these repositories can also be found in the [W3C Solid Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/solid/). 

# Implementations of the Solid Specifications
The implementation of the Solid specifications can be found in the following repos:
oidc-auth-manager, solid-multi-rp-client, folder-pane, pane-registry, oidc-rs, keychain, solid-pane, solid-notifications, solid-profile-ui, solid-connections-ui, pane-source, jose, solid-inbox, oidc-op, solid-tif, solid-client, oidc-rp, issue-panes, solid, solid-idp-list, kvplus-files, solid-email, oidc-web, solid-sign-up, solid, takeout-import, node-solid-ws, solid-auth-tls,  solid-auth-oidc, meeting-pane, solid-dips, solid-cli, solid-web-client, solid-permissions, acl-check, node-solid-server, solid-auth-client, wac-allow, mavo-solid, solid-auth-client, ldflex-playground, query-ldflex, react-components, profile-viewer-react, solid, solid-panes, solid-ui, mashlib

[Projects](https://github.com/orgs/solid/projects) with defined aims, managers, and teams, as described in the project descriptions work on the implementations of the Solid specification. The Project Manager is responsible for determining the scope of a [project](https://github.com/orgs/solid/projects) as well as supporting the coordination of the Project Team Member. The Project Manager will ensure that any issues and pull requests related to their project are assigned to Project Team Member, ensure that those assigned are on the case, and are responsible for merging pull requests and closing issues associated to their project. A Project Manager has admin rights over the project they manage. A Project Team Member is working on a specific official Solid [project](https://github.com/orgs/solid/projects). Project Team Members may have issues assigned to them by the Project  Manager. Project Team Members have admin rights of projects they are working on. If you would like to join an existing project, reach out to corresponding Project Manager. If you would like to start a new project, reach out to the Solid Manager with your project proposal including a defined aim, Project Manager, and Project Team.
