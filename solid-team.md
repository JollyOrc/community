Each test will take approximately 30 minutes, Solid Panelists are not obliged to participate in all tests, and Solid Panelists can stop being on the Solid Panel at any point. Tests will be designed to improve the Solid experience. Solid User Testing Panelists do not take part in the Solid support meeting nor in the solid/team gitter chat to avoid bias during the test.

Once the plan has been submitted the advisory board will be dismantled. Advisory board members will be appointed by the Solid Leader with the support of the Solid Manager.
