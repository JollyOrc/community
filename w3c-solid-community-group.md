__NOTOC__

The Solid Specifications ([https://github.com/solid/solid-spec Solid], [https://github.com/solid/web-access-control-spec Web Access Control], and [https://github.com/solid/webid-oidc-spec WebID OIDC]) describe how to decentralise power on the web to ensure that the web is used for the global public interest as defined by the Solid values.

=== Solid Values===
* Interoperability: Data should be interoperable to ensure that individuals or legal entities are able to self-determine independently of the technical possibilities. Technical hurdles should not be used as an excuse to not provide interoperability.
* Self Determination: People and legal entities should be given the tools for self-determination. Self-determination involves the app user controlling data generated as a result of using an application, rather than the developer or owner of the application. Data control includes deciding where the data is stored as well as who sees what data, for what purpose, when. No individual should make a decision on behalf of another individual without consultation and ensuring that the individually is equipped with the necessary information to make an informed decision on the matter at hand that does not take advantage of convenience nudging.
* Equal Access: There should be equal access to the web by all individuals both for consumption and creation. Although, for example, development, may take education, this education should be freely available and accessible by all.
* Sourcing: It should be easy to find the source of a piece of data so that one can judge the trustworthiness of the data.
* Public Value: The web should serve humanity to become more functional through collaboration leading toward mutual benefit. The long-term public interest should be given priority over the short-term private interest.
* Connecting: An individual or legal entity should be able to connect data they control to the data others control.

== Solid Specifications Changes ==

Anyone can suggest a change to the Solid specification by joining the [W3C Solid Community Group](https://www.w3.org/information/solid/wiki/Main_Page) and raising a suggestion as an item in the [agenda](https://www.w3.org/community/solid/wiki/Meetings) of the weekly call, submitting a pull request or issue to the GitHub repositories of the Solid specification, and writing an email to W3C Solid Community Group mailing list public-solid@w3.org. 

The [Solid Team](solid-team.md) supports the developement of the Solid specifications. The roles and responsibilites of the Solid Team are defined by the Solid Leader who also appoints individuals to those roles. If you would like to apply for a role, [contact the Solid Manager](solid-team.md) with your CV and motivation statement.

Changes to the spec are made using the following process: 

Step 1. Making a Suggestion
	If you would like to make a suggestion for a speific change to code or text submit a pull request and if you would like to raise a general point open an [issue](https://github.com/solid/information/tree/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE). 
	
 Step 2. Inviting a Conversation around your Suggestion to Find Consensus
	  Let others know about your suggestion by posting it on [solid/suggestions](https://gitter.im/solid/suggestions). Solid/suggestions is not a place to talk about the suggestion, this happens in the pull request or issue itself.How long does it take to process a suggestions? Pull requests and issues associated to the the spec (i.e. [solid spec](https://github.com/solid/solid-spec), [web access control spec](https://github.com/solid/web-access-control-spec), and [webid oidc spec](https://github.com/solid/webid-oidc-spec)) and the [Solid information repo](https://github.com/solid/information) need to be open for a minimum of three days to give other a chance to share their opinion to be considered. Pull requests and issues associated to all other repos can be closed immediately and do not have a minimum time they have to be left open unless they deviate from the spec in which case they need to be open for a minimum of three days. 
 
 Step 3. Coming to a Conclusion through Compromise  
 	Who is responsible for processing the suggestion? The repository manager of the repository to which the suggestion pertains to will be responsible for merging and closing the pull request or issue. If there is a difference of opinion, parties are encouraged to talk to find a compromise. If a compromise cannot be met the Solid Leader will make the final judgement.

== Implementation of the Solid Specifications==

Anyone can implement the Solid Specifications. To see who has built what or to let others know what you have built look at the list of [Solid Solutions](https://www.w3.org/community/solid/wiki/Main_Page#Solid_Solutions). [Solid World](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/solid-world-tickets-53692744444?aff=erellivmlt) is a podcast where you can get up to speed with Solid and tune into the latest conversations. You can also read the latest [status update](https://github.com/solid/information/blob/master/status.md).   

== Solid Press ==

The Solid Team occasionally give talks or write articles. You can find out about [upcoming talks](https://github.com/solid/information/blob/master/solid-team-talks.md) as well as see recordings of past talks on [Solid Resources](https://github.com/solid/information/blob/master/solid-resources.md). If you would like to invite one of the [Solid team](https://github.com/solid/information/blob/master/solid-team.md) for public speaking or for an interview for an article please [contact the Solid Manager](https://github.com/solid/information/blob/master/solid-roles.md) and provide the details. Solid Events provide an opportunity for anyone to meet and talk about Solid in person. Anyone can organise a Solid Event. If you are thinking about running a Solid Event in your city below is some guidance from previous Solid Event Organisers. If you have run a Solid Event, please contribute to the guidance information and share your learnings.
