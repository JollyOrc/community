# Changes to the Solid Specification 

Step 1. Making a Suggestion 
Anyone can suggest a change to the Solid specification by getting a GitHub account and submitting a pull request or issues to the Solid specification repositories. 

Step 2. Inviting a Conversation around your Suggestion to Find Consensus
You will then need to get a W3C account and join the W3C Solid Community Group to raise a conversation about your suggestion as an item on the weekly call agenda. By adding the item to the agenda all members of the W3C Solid Community Group will be automatically notified and therefore are able to comment on the pull request or issue directly. 

Step 3. Coming to a Conclusion through Compromise  
If there is a difference of opinion, parties are encouraged to talk to find a compromise. The Solid Specification Repository Manager is responsible for processing the suggestion to a change to the Solid specifications and deciding on the route forward. The repository manager of the repository to which the suggestion pertains to will be responsible for merging and closing the pull request or issue.  If a compromise cannot be met the Solid Leader will make the final judgement.
