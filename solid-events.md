Solid Events are run by members of the Solid community like you. Here you can find a comprehensive guide to help you along the way. Reach out to the Solid Manager to set up a call and brainstorm the organisation of your event. 

# Team 
A good team can make all the difference. Examples of roles include: 
- promotion 
- ticketing 
- equipment support 
- presentation host

# Venue
Partnering with existing meetups or organisations that regularly host events has the benefit of learning from their experience and benefit from their existing setup. Make sure to select a venue that can accommodate the amount of people you expect with sufficient tables and chairs. 

# Equipment
Organising a projector, sound system, and laptop for displaying the presentation in advance is important for a smooth running event. Make sure you have the right cables and preferably do a trial run before the event. If you partner with a venue that is familiar with hosting events, make sure to know who to contact about equipment setup. 

# Programme 
A general introduction to Solid to kickstart your Solid Event can be helpful for newcomers and to warm the attention of the crowd. If your event is general and targeted to a wide audience using Solid or looking to use Solid, it is important that you cover What, Why, How, When, described so anyone can understand. It is useful to talk about the core values that define the Solid design. Value based conversations can be an excellent route to moving these conversations forward. Questions to answer in the opening introduction include: What is Solid? Why should I use Solid? How can I use Solid?

The [FOSDEM talk by Ruben Verborgh](http://bofh.nikhef.nl/events/FOSDEM/2019/Janson/solid_web_decentralization.mp4) is a great introduction if you'd prefer to screen a recording. 

Demos of Solid solutions preferably by locals building on Solid help the audience focus on practical implementations. You can also ask Solid app developers for recorded demos. 

## Speakers 
Solid Events are a great opportunitiy to highlight local people building on Solid. Reach out to the Solid Team and ask  solid/chat on gitter to see if there are people local to you. 

## Debate Panel  
If you decide to set up a debate panel, define a theme or opening question. One way to focus the conversation is to set it up as a debate panel with multiple teams defending a specific perspective. Allocating people to defend perspectives they do not neccesarily agree with is a good way to open the mind and expand the debate.

## Entrepreneur-Investor Pitching 
One format is to invite local entrepreneurs and developers to pitch an idea for a Solid app or Pod Provider. You can also invite investors to pitch why their funds are appropriate for Solid values.

## Hackthons 
Hackathons are great for passing on knowledge between those who are familiar with Solid to those who are learning. It is useful to have a concrete target for your hackathon that you can work towards together. There is a collection of eduational materials available at [Solid Teaching Materials](solid-resources.md).
